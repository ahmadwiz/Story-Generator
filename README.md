## ⚠️ Problems Encountered & Solutions

### 🖼️ Problem 1: Figma Image Resizing Issues  
**Problem:** We experienced difficulties when trying to properly resize images in Figma for our front-end design.  

**Solution:** Instead of relying heavily on Figma for the full front-end layout, we used its stylistic components as a design reference and implemented similar designs directly using HTML and CSS.

---

### ⏳ Problem 2: Image Generation Lag  
**Problem:** Waiting for Gemini to generate images caused the entire application to hang and lag.  

**Solution:** We implemented parallel processing to generate and wait for images independently, allowing the rest of the application’s functionality to continue running smoothly.

### 🌐 Problem 3: Hosting Under a .tech Domain  
**Problem:** One of our biggest challenges was figuring out how to host our website under a `.tech` domain.  

**Solution:** With guidance from our hackathon organizers, we learned how to properly deploy our application using the Render and Vercel platforms.
